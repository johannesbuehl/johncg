# Client
You can access the client interface from any modern web browser within the same network by navigating to the server's IP address on port `:8888` (can be changed in config).

**Example**: `192.168.1.10:8888`

## Tips
- If you're accessing the client interface from the same machine as the server, use either [`localhost:8888`](http://localhost:8888) or [`127.0.0.1:8888`](http://127.0.0.1:8888).
- In Chrome: open the interface, than click the three dots, "Cast, save and share", "Install page as app" to "install" the client as a standalone Chrome-window.
