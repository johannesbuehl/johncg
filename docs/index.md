# JohnCG - character generator for song-lyrics and other church-service elements
JohnCG allows you to generate graphics for song lyrics or other church service elements and output them through CasparCG.

The program runs in a server-client configuration, enabling control from other machines on the same network. This makes it easy to manage and operate from multiple devices.

You can also configure additional outputs as stage monitors to optimize the view for performers. These stage monitor outputs will display the song lyrics without a background and, if available, include chords to assist musicians.
