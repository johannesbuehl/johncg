# PDF
Playout a pdf-file.

The individual pages get rendered to images in the resolution of the primary CasparCG-connection.
If other CasparCG-connections have a different aspect-ratio, the slides will be stretched.

After a PDF is added to the playlist, it is rendered into images, a process that takes a few seconds.
During rendering, the item will appear as unavailable in the playlist.
Once the rendering is complete, the playlist entry will automatically update, and the PDF will be ready for playback.
